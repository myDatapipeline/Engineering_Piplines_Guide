##### What your picture says (mapped)

Feature br → PR → CI & test → Main
Build & test every PR. Optionally spin up a DEV preview from the PR.

Tag Gate → Tag cutting & releases
Only after main is ready do you cut a version tag (manual or via Release-Please). That’s your gate.

Sequential deploys DEV → QA → UAT → PRD
Use Environments with required reviewers to gate QA/UAT/PRD; reuse the same artifact built at the tag. Final Approval Gate before PRD.


##### What this does

PRs: run tests and (optionally) deploy a DEV preview.

Push to main: opens a Release PR (your Tag Gate). Merging it automatically creates vX.Y.Z tag + GitHub Release.

Prefer manual tagging? Skip release_please and add a separate workflow_dispatch that runs git tag and pushes it. Keep everything else the same.
